# Library Management System (Java OOP)

## Overview
This project is a simple Library Management System built in Java to demonstrate core Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

It was originally developed as part of my Computer Science coursework and later refined for portfolio purposes.

## Features
- User roles (Admin / Staff)
- Book management
- Book borrowing and returning
- Encapsulation and inheritance structure
- Console-based interaction

## OOP Concepts Demonstrated
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Method overriding

## Project Structure
- `Book.java` – Represents book entity and operations
- `User.java` – Abstract base user class
- `SuperUser.java` – Admin functionality
- `Staff.java` – Staff functionality
- `Renter.java` – Borrower logic
- `LibraryApp.java` – Main application entry point

## How to Run
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java IDE).
2. Run `LibraryApp.java`.
3. Follow the console output.

## Future Improvements
- Add persistent storage (database)
- Add input validation
- Convert to GUI or Web-based interface
- Deploy as a cloud-hosted application
